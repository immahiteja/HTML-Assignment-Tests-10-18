                It marked the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte, who had conquered much of Europe in the early 19th century. 
                The battle was fought between Napoleon's 72,000 French troops and the Duke of Wellington's army of 68,000 soldiers 
                aided by 45,000 Prussians.
                The battle ended 23 years of recurrent warfare between France and other powers in Europe.

                and his ambitions for a European empire.
                The battle also led to significant changes in Europe's political landscape and

                Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō destroyed the Russian fleet, under Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, which had traveled 
                over 18,000 nautical miles to reach the Far East1. In the fighting, the Russian fleet was effectively destroyed with
                21 ships sunk and six captured. Of the Russian crews, 4,380 were killed and 5,917 captured2. Only three ships escaped
                to reach Vladivostok, while another six were interned in neutral ports2.

                It was the turning point of the war in favor of the Allies and resulted in the destruction of the German Sixth Army and other Axis forces.

                repulsed the first Persian invasion of Greece, led by Darius I, who wanted to punish the Greeks for 
                supporting the Ionian revolt. The battle was a turning point in European history, as it showed the 
                Persians could be beaten and paved the way for the rise of the Classical Greek civilization. 
                The battle also inspired the legend of a messenger running from Marathon to Athens to announce the victory, 
                which became the basis for the modern marathon race</td>

                of the American Civil War, involving around 160,000 soldiers from the Union and the Confederacy1. 
                After a great victory over Union forces at Chancellorsville, General Robert E. Lee marched his Army of Northern Virginia
                into Pennsylvania in late June 18632. The battle resulted in a Union victory and is considered the most important engagement 
                of the American Civil War2. It was also the turning point of the war, as it ended Lee's attempt to invade the North and
                secure the independence of the Confederate States of America1. 
                It inspired Lincoln's “Gettysburg Address,” which became one of the most famous speeches of all time2.</td>
